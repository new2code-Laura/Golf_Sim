• A canvas for the mini golf hole including green grass and a black hole
• A golf ball of any colour
• The ball should be initialized with appropriate coordinates i.e. on the tee box
• The ball should be initialized with an appropriate velocity in the X and Y direction upon each
stroke
• The grass should have an appropriate coefficient of friction
• The ball should be struck. If the ball is not in the hole when it comes to rest, the ball is struck
again
• When the ball is in the hole, the game ends
• The game should feature a stroke counter and display an appropriate message at the end

• The game should include walls around the perimeter of the hole. These walls do not have to
be displayed but a collision with the edge should result in the ball bouncing off the wall with
appropriate physics
• The ball should be initialized with random velocities in the X and Y direction every stroke. Your
solution must not hardcode the values such that the ball moves along one axis and into the
hole. This overrules the conditions above.
• There should be at least two different terrains with different coefficients of friction e.g. grass
and sand or flat and a hill. The terrains should have different coefficients of friction and/or
physics

• This is a multiplayer game meaning there must be at least 3 balls. You may choose the order
in which shots are taken e.g. one at a time, all at once, one player finishes the hole out etc.
• There must be a moving obstacle e.g. a wall that moves from side to side, a windmill etc. If
the ball collides with the moving obstacle, the ball should bounce with appropriate physics.
• Add one unique feature to your courses
